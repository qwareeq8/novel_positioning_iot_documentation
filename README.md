## Project Overview

This project presents the design of a novel positioning system for the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The report details:
- The motivation behind developing an indoor/outdoor positioning system with minimal equipment cost.
- A comprehensive explanation of the system’s architecture and methodology.
- Experimental procedures, data generation, and simulation results.
- Deep Learning (DL) model development using an ANN and an LSTM network.
- Optimization of beacon placements via advanced algorithms.
- Detailed discussions on results, engineering impact, and conclusions.
  
The documentation includes all aspects of the project—from the initial introduction and background through the detailed procedures, results, and discussion, to the conclusions and future work.
